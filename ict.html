              <p><strong>Information and Communications Technology (ICT)</strong>  is technology that is used to handle communications processes such as telecommunications, broadcast media, intelligent building management systems, audiovisual processing and transmission systems, and network-based control and monitoring functions.</p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>In a very simplified sense, ICT is used to talk about all of the technologies that facilitate communications.

                With that in mind, the term ICT has had several differing definitions applied to it. It's generally associated with consolidating and managing telecom infrastructure and converging technologies that have common transmission lines.</p>
